This report follows the process improvement efforts conducted for a Lego scrum workshop. After preparing a process in groups, all groups came together as an organization and attempted to form a common process and build Lego city.
Following this experience I analyzed the flaws in the process and searched relevant literature for a fitting approach to improving the process. A relevant solution was found in iFLAP combined with GQM for data elicitation and prepared for the use in another iteration of the workshop.
