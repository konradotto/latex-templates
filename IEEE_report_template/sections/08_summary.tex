\section{Summary and Lessons Learned}
\label{sec:summary}
This report discusses different approaches to software process improvement in context of the experiences made during the first Lego scrum workshop. The conclusion of the literature research on the topic is that iFLAP using GQM for data acquisition offers a feasible light-weight approach for inexperienced teams like in our case. The challenges to SPI described in the literature often involve an overcomplicated or badly understood SPI approach. Staying light-weight is one way of mitigating that challenge.
